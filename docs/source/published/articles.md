Articles
========

Once an article is published you may need to make changes to it eg.
uploading a new galley or tweaking the metadata if there is an error.

All published articles can be found on the Articles page under Back
Content. The Article back content page lists both published and rejected
papers. You can search and then select an article to edit.

You can also edit papers by going to their page and using the account
drop down to select the Edit Article link.

From this page you can:

-   Edit metadata
-   Edit publication information
-   Add/remove images
-   Create Publisher Notes
-   Manage identifiers
-   Manage galley files
-   Manage which issues an article appears in
-   If an article is rejected, unreject the article

Metadata
--------

The first block of the page lists most of the article\'s metadata. To
change it you can press the Edit button.

Additionally you can make changes to the author records and re-order
them as required.

Publication Information
-----------------------

The article archive page has a link to the Pre Publication page where
you can make changes to any details there.

Images
------

Articles have two images

-   

    Large image

    :   -   A large landscape image.

-   

    Thumbnail image

    :   -   A small square image displayed next to the article on the
            Articles/Issue list pages.

-   

    Meta image

    :   -   This is used on platforms like Twitter and Facebook when a
            link is shared, generally the large image is used but in
            some cases this needs to be overwritten.

Publisher Notes
---------------

Publisher notes appear on the article page below the abstract and how to
cite block. These can be used to notify readers of small changes to the
paper like a post-publication update to fix spelling etc.

Identifiers
-----------

Any identifiers such as DOIs are listed here and a link to manage them
is in the top right of the block.

You can also manage DOIs at the journal level as an editor (and at the
press level as a staff user) using the
`DOI Manager<doimanager>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

Galleys
-------

Much like the Production page, the article archive allows you to upload
new and replace old Galley files.

![Galley manager block](/nstatic/galleys_archive.png)

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

Editing a galley will change how it is displayed. If making changes to a
published piece it is recommended you add a Publisher Note alongside it.

The Edit Galleys link will take you to the Production page.

Issues
------

You can see the issues that an article is part of at the bottom of the
Article Archive page. You can edit each of the issues or jump to the
issue manager.

![Archive issue block](/nstatic/archive_issue.png)

Actions
-------

You can unreject a previously rejected article using this button. You
will have the opportunity to write an email to the author before the
change takes effect.

If the article was previously assigned to an editor, the article will
move to the Review stage. Otherwise, it will move to the Unassigned
stage.
