Author Guide
============
The Author role is granted to all users of a given journal whey they begin a submission. This guide will help you make a submission in Janeway.
  
Notes on the Submission System
------------------------------
We have written this guide to help anyone when submitting to a Janeway journal and make the process as usable and accessible as possible. However, we are always open to suggestions to improve the submission process and Janeway more broadly.

Generally all Janeway journals submission systems will look the same, along the top of the page you will see a timeline style bar that has 5 stages. You can use this bar to jump back and forward along the submission process if you need to make changes to an earlier screen. Once a stage has been completed it will turn into a link for you to click on (see image below).

Creating a New Submission
---------------------
There are various ways to make a submission on Janeway:

1. From the ‘Submission’ page on the main site (if this is not visible on a journal website, they may not be accepting new submissions).
Note: Not all journals may have the 'Start a submission' option in the menubar enabled.
.. figure:: /nstatic/submissions_webpage
:alt: An example 'Submissions' page. The 'Submissions' button on the page and the navbar items for 'Start a submission' and 'Submissions' are highlighted.

If you already have an account:
2. From the drop down in the top right hand corner where you name is displayed

3. From the author dashboard within Janeway
.. figure:: /nstatic/author_dashboard_block.png
:alt: The author dashboard block in Janeway. 'Submit New Article' in the topright corner of the block is highlighted.


Whichever way you choose, you will usually be given the ‘Author’ role in Janeway when you submit an article. However, some journals will have this disabled and you will be asked to select and input the details of the manuscript’s author.
        
The Author Agreement
---------------------
The first page of a submission displays the author agreement text and various text boxes. Please note that not all of these fields may be displayed, depending on how a journal has been set up.

- Publication Fees
    - This field will inform you of any publication fees and may list any APCs that apply to the submission.
- Submission Checklist
    - The Submission Checklist will display any steps you need to take before submitting the manuscript (e.g. formatting).
- Copyright Notice
    - The Copyright Notice should tell you what licence the paper will be published under and any rights you may need to sign over to the publisher.
- Competing Interests
    - If you have any competing interests that the Editors should take into account when examining your paper.
   
If enabled, the Publication Fees, Submission Checklist and Copyright notice boxes _must_  be checked in order to complete a submission. If you have any issues with any of the clauses it is suggested you get in touch with the editor before proceeding.

Article Information
-------------------
The Article Information page displays a form with a series of input boxes. This is where you will insert the majority of your paper's metadata including:

- Title
    - This field is always required.
- Subtitle
- Abstract
    - Individual journals can make the abstract field required or not
- Language
    - This is disabled if the journal only accepts one language.
- Section
    - Denotes what type of article the paper is (eg. Research, Review, Editorial etc.)
- License
    - This is disabled if the journal only accepts one licence.
- Keywords
    - Type your keyword, press enter and it will be entered. If you wish to delete a keyword, press the ‘X’ icon next to it within the textbox. You can have multi word keywords (see keyword image below)

:alt: The article information page filled with example data
    
Individual journals can add additional fields which will be displayed under "Additional Fields".
    
Author Information
------------------
Authors can be added on the Author Information page. Some journals will automatically assign the submitting user as an author, for others this information will need to be added manually (see below).

.. figure:: /nstatic/no_authors.png
:alt: The author information page. There is no author information visible yet (the submitting users has not been automatically added) but the 'Add Self as Author' and 'Add New Author' buttons are visible on the left, on the right is the 'Current Authors' section which is currently empty.

    In this example journal the submitting user has not been added as an author but can use the "Add self as author" button to add themselves

To add additional authors we can either search the journal's author list or create a new author. If you were to use the Add New Author button to add an author who's email address is in the database this will not create a new record but add their existing record to your submission.

- Search
    - You can search the journal's database of authors using email address or ORCID (the latter is preferred). If a matching record is found they will be added as a co-author. If not, you will be notified that no account has been found.
- Add Authors
    - You can use the Add New Author button to create a new author record for your co-authors if they don't have one already. Clicking the button shows a popup with a series of fields to complete. The following fields are mandatory in Janeway:
        - First Name
        - Last Name
        - Institution (can be supplied as 'N/A' or 'Independent' for those who do not have one)
        - Email Address
    - An account will be generated so the co-author can log in to the journal to check the progress of the paper. They will need to use the Password Reset function to get access to their account.
    
.. figure:: /nstatic/current_authors.png
:alt: The 'Current authors' sections, with two authors visible.

There are now two authors added to the submission. You can use the trash icon to delete authors and the arrow handles to drag and drop to re-order the authors.

Article Files
-------------
Here you can upload your manuscript and any figure or data files that go along with it.

 .. figure:: /nstatic/upload_files.png
:alt: The 'Articles Files' page, displaying a section to upload manuscript files and a section to upload figures and data files besides it. Nothing has been uploaded yet.

Select one of the Upload buttons and a pop-up will appear, you can select the file using the "Choose file". You are required to add a label but the description field is optional.

 .. figure:: /nstatic/submit_ms.png
:alt: The manuscript upload pop-up screen, displaying the 'Choose file' button, and 'Label' and 'Description' fields.
    
You can only add one manuscript file but can repeat the upload process for figures and date files. The label of figure files should match the image in the manuscript (figure 1, figure 2 etc).

Review
------
The review page displays a run down of the article you've submitted, metadata, files and authors. Once you have reviewed your submission you can complete or return to other stages to make changes.

 .. figure:: /nstatic/article_review.png
:alt: The review page for the article displaying all the metadata entered so far.


Peer-review and Revisions
---------
Editors may request that authors revise their files based on recommendations from reviewers. There are two types of revision decision:

1. Minor Revisions.
2. Major Revisions.

With Major Revisions the paper will be send for a second review round once you have completed your revisions.

When an Editor request revisions there are two ways to start this process:

1. Click the link in the email sent to you.
2. Via the Journal Dashboard:
    1. Login to the Journal.
    2. Go to the Journal Dashboard.
    3. Scroll down to "Submitted Articles".
    4. Click the "Revision Request" button next to the article.

Once you have accessed the revision request, you will be able to view available peer reviews and download, revise or upload new files. Once you have uploaded a revised manuscript and any additional files you can fill in the covering letter / comments and save the revision.

Copyediting
-----------
Editors and authors are encouraged to undertake as many rounds of copyediting as is necessary to ensure that the text is ready to go into production. 

It is important that all stylistic changes are made at this stage. As many errors as possible should be corrected at this point, and by the end of copyediting there should be a final manuscript which requires no further changes. The typesetters will then use this final manuscript to create the finished article, which will be sent back for checking in the form of typeset proofs. 

Typeset proofs are not an opportunity to make changes to the content or style of a manuscript: the file that goes into production is final. It is expected that only a handful (less than 10) of very minor changes should be requested at the proofing stage, if any.

When an Editor requests an Author Revision following a copyedit:

1. Click the link in the email sent to you to access the file.
2. Alternatively, to access this via the Journal Dashboard:
    1. Login to the Journal .
    2. Go to the Journal Dashboard.
    3. Scroll down to 'Submitted Articles'. 
    4. Click the'Copyediting Review' button next to the article.

.. figure:: /nstatic/author_copyedit_1.png
:alt: The 'Submitted Articles' section, displaying an article ready for copyediting review.

Once you have accessed the Copyediting Review request you will be able to view requested copyedits and download the copyedited file. Copyedits are made as tracked changes.

Please accept all tracked changes you agree with and address any queries the copyeditor has made in the comments. Check your manuscript carefully to ensure you have not introduced any new errors before uploading your revised file. 

To complete a Copyediting Review: 

1. Upload your revisions to the copyedited manuscript. You can do so by replacing the copyeditor's version of the file with your own updated version.

 .. figure:: /nstatic/author_copyedit_2.png
:alt: A section displaying the copyedited files.

2. Fill in the 'Note to the Editor' with any additional information.
3. Select a decision (either ‘Accept’ or ‘Corrections Required’).
4. Click ‘Complete Copyedit Task’.

 .. figure:: /nstatic/author_copyedit_3.png
:alt: The 'Complete task' section for copyediting review. It displays the 'Note to Editor' and 'Decision' fields.


Proofing
--------
After your paper has been accepted and copyedited, the editors might send you a request to proof the 'Typesetting Files'.
These files are the final versions that will be made publicly available once the article gets published.

For journals that publish content in multiple media formats (HTML, PDF, XML...) It is important that you check all these files before publication. Authors are not expected to be able to open and read XML/HTML code. Instead, Janeway provides a 'preview' button were you will be able to preview the article the way it will display once published.


 .. figure:: /nstatic/typesetting/proofreading_1.png
:alt: Typeset Files download and preview section.

Once you've previewed the files, you can provide feedback in two ways:

1. Fill in the "Notes" field. You can write feedback, as well as pasting in screenshots or other types of images

 .. figure:: /nstatic/typesetting/proofreading_notes.png
:alt: An example of proofreading notes in the 'Notes' field.

2. Upload an annotated file. In the case of PDF files, you can download the file and make annotations offline using PDF reading and annotating software. when this is done, you can upload the annotated file for the editor to review.

 .. figure:: /nstatic/typesetting/proofreading_2.png
:alt: The 'Files' section where an annotated file would be uploaded with proofreading notes.

It is important to proof all the files thoroughly in order to avoid unnecessary follow-up rounds that will cost more time (and money) for the journal's editorial team and publishers.

Once you have provded your feedback, it is possible that the editorial team might send you another proofing tasks once the requested corrections have been applied. In that case, the process to follow is the same as explained above.
