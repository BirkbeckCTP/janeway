Many base press-level settings are available under **Edit Press
Details**.

## Journal footer text

As a press manager, you can control some of the elements that appear in
website footer of every journal.

Some journal indexers require a postal address to be displayed on every
journal website. You can add this kind of information with **Edit Press
Details** \> **Journal footer text**.
