Books plugin
=============

Through this plugin, all book-related tasks and metadata are managed. This plugin has three key functionalities:
- Adding new books through either individual uploads or a bulk import.
- Metrics for reporting (overall or monthly)
- Categories - this can be used for imprints, series or other types of categorisation you may wish to use for published materials.

Main dashboard
----------------

.. figure:: nstatic/books_dashboardblock.png
    :alt: Books plug-in dashboard, displaying all books with titles and their details (outlined in the text following this image), and the various functionalities in the right-hand top.

From the books dashboard, you can manage all tasks and data related to monographs (or similar items). It also provides an overview of all items published through this plug-in and the following information for all of them (they can also be sorted by any of these):
- ID
- Title
- Subtitle
- First Author
- ISBN
- DOI
- Date Published
- Reads
- Downloads

.. figure:: nstatic/books_dashboardblock_highlight.png
    :alt: " "

The bar on top represents access to the key functions of the books plugin:
- Metrics by Month
- (General) Metrics
- Import Books
- Categories
- Add New Book

Categories
------------
This is where categories can be created that books can be assigned to; such as imprints, collections or even record labels. 

All current categories are displayed on the right-hand side, with a link to the live website where you can view all monographs currently present in a category.

Whilst books can be assigned to a category at any moment, it is necessary to create the category before a book can be assigned. Categories cannot be created through the ‘Add a new book’ interface.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_category_dahboard.png
    :alt: The categories dashboard, listing the existing categories on the left. For the existing categories, the number of books in the category are displayed, as well as buttons to edit and delete. On the right, the form to add a new category is visible with multiple textboxes.

When adding a new category, the following fields are available:

- Name
    - This is a required field.
- Description
- Display title
    - Leave this unchecked if you want to hide the category title.
- Chapter name
    - This is where the ‘Chapter’ label can be edited, in case the individual components of publications assigned to this category are not chapters. This is a required field.
- Chapter name plural
    - This is where the plural for the ‘Chapter’ label can be edited to ensure the label is pluralised correctly. This is a required field.
- Buy button text
    - This defaults to “Buy this Book”. If the item is not a book, you will need to update this field. This is a required field.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_Category_display.png
    :alt: An example of how changing the ‘Chapter name’ fields results in a change on the website. Instead of ‘Chapters’ it reads ‘Assignment Sets’ on the dropdown. The text in the dropdown now reads ‘Introduction to Open Access - workbook (the title) has the following Assignment Sets:’. It then goes on to list these.

.. note:: This field is case-sensitive. If you do not wish for these words to be capitalised by default (and thus mid-sentence), you need to enter them in lowercase. See the image above for an example of how this label displays when it is capitalised. Janeway will automatically capitalise the words when they appear at the start of a sentence.

Adding a new book
-------------------
New monographs are added through the ‘Add new book’ option, which is positioned rightmost in the topbar of the main dashboard. 
.. figure:: nstatic/books_addbook_dash.png
    :alt: The ‘Add a new book’ page. On the left, the book details can be filled into various text boxes. On the right are sections for ‘Contributors’, ‘Formats’ and ‘Chapters’. These are currently blocked, which is indicated for each of them with a red bar and the text “Save book before adding contributors/formats/chapters”.

Before the manuscript files can be uploaded, various metadata fields need to be completed first, displayed on the left-hand side of the page under ‘Book details’.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_addbook_details.png
    :alt: " "

This section 
contains the following fields:

- Prefix
- Title
    - This is a required field.
- Subtitle
- Category
    - This is where a publication can be assigned to an imprint, if applicable.
- Description
    - The book’s description can be provided here.
- Pages
    - This is the total number of pages.
- Edited volume?
    - If this is an edited volume, tick this box. This will ensure the citation is adjusted to match.
- Open Access?
    - If this monograph is Open Access, tick this box. This will ensure the monograph is marked as open access and made available on the website.
- Date embargo
    - This will specify the date until which the title is embargoed.
- Date published
    - This will specify the date of publication (this can be before the upload date for example if the official publication date precedes the date on which the digital edition was made available).
- Publisher name
    - This is a required field.
- Publisher location
    - This is a required field.
- Cover
- DOI
    - DOIs for monographs and chapters cannot be minted directly through Janeway, but if a DOI has been chosen, it can be added here. To mint a DOI for a monograph or chapter after it has been uploaded, you can do so through the Crossref website: https://apps.crossref.org/webDeposit/
- ISBN
- Purchase URL
    - If this book has an option for physical purchase, this is where this can be linked. It will show as an option next to the ‘Read’ and ‘Download’ buttons on the book’s page.
- Remote URL
    - If this monograph is not hosted on Janeway but you would like it linked on the website, this is where to provide the link. If the monograph is hosted on Janeway (if you are uploading manuscript files), there is no need for this.
- Remote label
    - This will set the label for the link above. If not set, it will display the domain name.
- Licence information
    - Add copyright and/or licence information here.
- Custom how-to-cite
    - To be used only if the citation block generated by Janeway is not suitable.

After the required fields above have been filled in and you have pressed ‘Save Book’, you can now move onto the following steps (displayed on the right-hand side in Janeway):

Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All contributors to a volume can be entered here. If you are uploading individual chapters in addition to the full manuscript, the respective authors and/or contributors for these chapters will need to be entered here. If they are not entered here, they can not be selected as contributors when uploading individual chapters.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_add_contributor.png
    :alt: The page for adding new contributors and its fields.

This page contains the following fields:

- First name
    - This is a required field.
- Middle name
- Last name
    - This is a required field.
- Affiliation
    - This is a required field.
- Email
- Sequence
    - This determines the order in which contributors are displayed and will be auto-filled (but can be edited). This is a required field.

Formats
~~~~~~~~~

This is where manuscript files are uploaded. Various file types can be used, such as PDF, ePub and Mobi.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_.png
    :alt: The page where manuscript files can be uploaded. Fields are described in the text below this image.

This page contains the following fields:
- Title
    - The title field is where you specify the format. This will be displayed on the website as ‘Download [title]’ (see image below). This field is case-sensitive, so you may wish to be consistent with capitalisation. This is a required field.
- Sequence
    - The sequence field will determine in what order the respective ‘Read’ and ‘Download’ options will be displayed. This is useful to ensure consistency in order of the options across books.

When an .ePub is uploaded, Janeway will generate a ‘Read this book’ option on the book page. This allows users to read the book using an online reader, without requiring a download. This can be disabled on request.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_.png
    :alt: The download, read, and buy buttons as they appear to users on the press website.

Make sure that the filename of the file uploaded is consistent and correct. Whilst Janeway will change the filename to the title internally, depending on the application used to open the document after download, the original filename might still be visible. Google Chrome is an example of an application that might still display the original filename in its reader toolbar, as displayed in the image below.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_.png
    :alt: " "

.. note:: ‘Read this book’ will always follow the ePub download option and ‘Buy this book’ will always be the last one in the sequence.

Chapters
~~~~~~~~~~
.. figure:: nstatic/books_.png
    :alt: Chapter dashboard with various fields for entering metadata.

If uploading individual chapters, this is where they are uploaded and the metadata is entered. This might be of particular interest if the book is an edited volume with multiple contributors; individual chapter uploads with their respective metadata allow for higher discoverability. 

.. note:: The chapter-level uploads are limited to one file, so only one file type can be used here.

This page contains the following fields:

- Title
    - This is a required field.
- Description
    - This is a required field.
- Pages
- DOI
    - Janeway will not automatically generate a DOI for individual chapters, these will need to be registered with Crossref manually. This can be done through the `Crossref website <https://apps.crossref.org/webDeposit/>`_ 
- Number
    - This is where the chapter number is set; this can be zero for prelims, appendices etc.
- Date embargo
- Date published
- Sequence
    - This will determine in what order the chapters are displayed. This field will autofill and chapters will appear in the order they were added to Janeway, but this can be edited through this field. This is a required field.
- Contributors
    - This is where contributors to chapters can be selected, for them to appear their details need to have been entered in the ‘Contributors’ fields through the Book Details dashboard.
- Licence information
- Keywords
    - This is currently a list from which keywords can be selected. This will be updated in the future.

Importing books
-------------------
You can import the metadata for multiple monographs into Janeway at once using the ‘import books’ option. This is commonly used for migrations.

Metadata can be imported using a .csv file encoded in UTF-8[#] with certain headers. There is an example import here, with pre-prepared headers: books plugin example import [hyperlink to file].

These headers are:

==================== =================================== ================= 
Field                Notes                               Required?

.. [#] Using a character encoding other than UTF-8 can cause bugs during imports or updates. `(What is character encoding?) <https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding>`_. These apps save .csvs with UTF-8 by default: OpenRefine, LibreOffice, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers. However! If you use Microsoft Excel, keep in mind some versions don’t automatically create .csv files with UTF-8 character encoding. This may cause punctuation and special characters to be garbled on import. So, when saving, look for the ‘.csv (UTF-8)’ option in the drop-down box.
.. [#] Required due to a bug - we aim to fix this in the near future.

.. warning:: Due to a bug, UTF8 does not seem to be properly recognised when specific browser-editor combinations are used. We are investigating this. If the file is not properly read upon upload, you may also wish to try a regular .csv file (not UTF8 encoded). If you still encounter an error, please contact Support.

Once the import file has successfully been uploaded, the imported books will show on the main dashboard. You can now click on these to upload the files themselves and to make any further edits.

Reporting metrics for books
----------------------------
Reporting for books does not run through the reporting plug-in, instead it is done separately through the books plug-in.

.. figure:: nstatic/books_.png
    :alt: The Book metrics page.

On this page, you can view the general access metrics for monographs, as well as for each format of a monograph. On this page, date ranges can be selected per day, rather than per month as in the ‘Metrics by month’ page. The date range affects both the Book Metrics field and the Format Metrics field.

.. note:: If a monograph is not available for open-access downloading/reading, no data will be collected and the metrics will remain at 0.

Books metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first section of this dashboard displays the total views and downloads (each in their respective column) per book. The columns can be sorted by ID, Title, Subtitle, First Author name, Date published, Reads and Downloads.
.. figure:: nstatic/books_monthlymetrics_dashboard.png
    :alt: " "

Format Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section sorts the data by format, providing insights into how specific formats are performing. This section can be sorted by Format, Title, Views and Downloads.
.. figure:: nstatic/books_.png
    :alt: " "

.. note:: The total views and downloads in this report may differ slightly from the amounts listed in the monthly report discussed above. This is due to an issue with time zones and the cutoff points used for the calculation.
